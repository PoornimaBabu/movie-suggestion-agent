## 🚀 How It Works

Just type something like:

> _“I'm feeling nostalgic, maybe something in Tamil?”_

Claude, guided by precise instructions via Agno, will:

1. Extract your **mood** + **language**.
2. Map them to appropriate genres (e.g., "sad" → drama).
3. (Optionally) Call a movie database like TMDB (functionality to be added).
4. Return a **Markdown-formatted** list of curated movie picks.
